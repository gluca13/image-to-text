# image-to-text
CLI python application that extracts the text within an image to a *.txt* file. The image must have some text in it for this app to work.

The application receives the path to the image wanted to extract the text, and generates a *.txt* file containing the correspondent text.

This project is intended to see the potential of AI, specifically digital image processing.

## Getting Started
### *1.	Installation process*
In order to have character recognition capabilities in this application, it is necessary to install ***pytesseract** Optical Character Recognition* library.

```bash
pip install pytesseract
```

The library (if used on Windows OS) requires the tesseract.exe binary to be also present for proper installation of the library. During the [installation](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) of the aforementioned executable, we would be prompted to specify a path for it. This path needs to be remembered as it would be utilized later on in the code. For most installations the path would be *C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe*

###  *2. Running the application*
The application is run by executing the following command in the terminal:

**Linux**
```bash
    python3 Converter.py
```

**Windows**
```bash
    python Converter.py
```

The application will prompt the user to enter the path to the image file. The path can be entered as follows:

**1. Entering the path to the image file directly**

Example:

```bash
    Type the path to the image file: C:\Users\Gianluca\Desktop\test.jpg
```

**2. Entering the path to the image file by dragging and dropping the file into the terminal**

Example:

```bash
    Type the path to the image file: c:\Users\Gianluca\Desktop\test.jpg
```

###  *3. Output*

The application will generate a *.txt* file containing the text extracted from the image. The file will be saved in the same directory as the image file and the path will be prompted in the terminal.

## Tests

The application was tested with the following image:

The output of the application was the following:
